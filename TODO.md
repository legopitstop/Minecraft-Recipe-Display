# TODO
- [ ] XP and cook time.
- [ ] When page contains A LOT of recipes display a msgbox explaining that the page contains too many recipes and should be split. (when over 157 recipes)
  - Only load reicpe/texture when that part of the page is rendered.
- [ ] When page has been fully loaded return (via console) the total amount of recipes that have been loaded.
- [ ] Add URL override for items. (for diffrent pages)
- [ ] Update spritesheet to include all new items
- [ ] If item in recipe is invalid show a msgbox showing that the page has errors. If it has multiple errors add log download?
